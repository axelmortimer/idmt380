# IDMT380 Group Beta
We are currently working on the Aphal version. 
## Current Progress
* Both index page and single page are not fully responsive. 
* Color picking and tile carousel are functional
* Svgs are in progress
* Everything will be styled better to match the wireframe
## Files Location
* ~/collaboration/aphal
* ~/collaboration/color-picker
* ~/collaboration/carousel-test
* ~/wireframe
## How to test
* Index page goes to: [http://yuangli.com/test/index.html] (http://yuangli.com/test/index.html)
* For Index page, click `Pre` and `Next` or swipe upon the image to navigate (no buttons for mobile version)
* There is no href on the page, beacuse we want to make everything in one page
* Single page goes to: [http://yuangli.com/test/page.html] (http://yuangli.com/test/page.html)
* For Single page, there will be a artboard, color palette and a color indicator
* Choose your color by clicking the color indicator and then select the part you want to fill with that color
* Refresh the page to reset and undo
